                6. YOUR RIGHTS
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>With respect of your personal data, you have the following rights provided for in the legislation,
            namely:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The right to be informed about the processing of your personal data. We are obliged to provide clear
                and transparent information about our data processing activities. This is provided in this Policy.</li>
            <li>The right to access one’s personal data and the way it is processed. You have the right to obtain the
            confirmation of the Company that the Company processes your personal data as well as to access your personal
            data being processed and other related information. Also, this enables you to receive a copy of the personal
            data we hold about you. In order to provide you with requested data, we may have to verify the identity of
            the requester, if necessary.</li>
            <li>The right to rectify incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete data. If you believe that your information
            which is processed by the Company is inaccurate or incorrect, you have the right to request to change,
            revise or rectify this information. However, we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide
            to us.</li>
            <li>The right to request the deletion of your personal data (“right to be forgotten”). Under certain
            circumstances listed in the applicable legislation (where personal data are processed illegally, the grounds
            for the processing of data have ceased to exist, etc.), you have the right to request that the Company would
            delete your personal data.</li>
            <li>The right to request to restrict the processing of your personal data. Under certain circumstances
            listed in the applicable legislation (where personal data are processed illegally, you have contested the
            accuracy of data, etc.), you have the right to request that the Company would restrict the processing of
            your personal data. Where processing has been restricted, such personal data shall, with the exception of
            storage, only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims
            or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public
            interest.</li>
            <li>The right to request to transfer your personal data to another data controller or to provide them
            directly in any form convenient for you. You have the right to obtain the data which are processed by the

            them to another data controller.</li>
            <li>The right to object to the processing of your personal data if such personal data is processed on the
            basis of a legitimate interest. If personal data is processed on the basis of a legitimate interest, you may
            object to such processing of your personal data, except for the cases stipulated by law. In this case the
            Company will no longer process the personal data unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the
            processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence
            of legal claims.</li>
            <li>The right to withdraw the consent given for the processing of personal data at any time (where your
            personal data are processed on the basis of separate consent). Upon the withdrawal of your consent to
            process your personal data, the data processing based on your consent will be terminated. However, your
            withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
            <li>The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. You have the right to lodge a complaint
            with a supervisory authority in the EU member state of your habitual residence, place of work or place of
